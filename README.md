## Environment

This course assumes that you're using a [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) development environment. If you're using macOS or Linux, you already have one of these!

*If you wish to use windows, please setup [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (recommended) or [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).*

### Another option for an environment: Codesandbox!
[CodeSandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io) can be thought of as "vscode in a browser tab". Free accounts are full-featured!

- [Click here](https://githubbox.com/mike-works/typescript-fundamentals-v4) to visit the sandbox
- Login with your github account to create your own fork

## Dependencies

Make sure your system is set up with
- *Node.js* - using [Volta](http://volta.sh) makes setup extremely easy!
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links) (should be globally installed)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started#installation-and-usage) (should be globally installed)
- (macOS Only) [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)


### Recommended other tools

While not strictly required, you may want the following tools to follow exactly what you see the instructor do

* [`bat` - a modernized `cat` alternative](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#installation)
* [`tldr` - a "cliff's notes" alternative to man pages](https://tldr.sh/#installation)
